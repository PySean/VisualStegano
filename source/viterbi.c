/*
   There'll be six tables for making our viterbi algorithm:

   1. next_state. This stores all the possible states that you can get depending on what your current state x (array[x][2]) is.
      say we had a current state of 10, that would be array[2]. At current state 10, there's only two possible "next" states it can have,
      depending on whether a 1 or 0 is input. array[2][0] would store 01 and array[2][1] would store 11.

   2. output. Works in the same way as the previous array. The name represents what's stored (in this case, products of XORing input and
      flip-flops). The row bracket represents the current state once again, while the column is either 0 or 1 as input.

   3. input. Inputs of either 0 or 1 are stored this time, while row reperesents current state and column is next state. Since
      states can only have two different next states, not all the slots in this array will be used.
*/

//The three above must be initialiazed. They act as a sort of reference guide. This will be done through prototype:

void initialize(unsigned char  next[][2], unsigned char  output[][2], unsigned char input[][4]);

/*

   4. state_his. State history. Stores the best previous state into the current state. The "best" previous state
      is determined by the lowest "accumulated error" which will be explained in 5. According to a website
      this array is limited to storing K x 5 + 1 data ( where K = 3). I wish to be able to store things in groups of 8
      (obviously) so this instead will hold 19 pieces of data. Index 0 Holds the initial set up, 1-16 holds the recieved data,
      and 17-18 are the "flush bits". These two will be shifted down to indexes 1 and 2, as they're actual data that needs
      to be processed. The final bits stored in 17 and 18 will be discarded since they are the actual flush bits.

   5. error_total. Stores "accumulated error metric" in  each [state]. The error metric is determined by XORING the output created with the
      recieved bits at that index. As is the usual, the current state has multiple (in this case 2) "next states" depending on whether
      the input is a 0 or 1. The error metric created (from Xoring the output with the recieved convolution bits) will be stored into that
      next state. Each next state has multiple (2) different error metric. Whichever metric lower will have its state stored into the state_his.
      If they turn out to be equal either can be picked.

   6. state_seq. The states are selected from the end
